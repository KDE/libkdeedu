/** BEEP BEEP BEEP this will likely be removed as Qt 4.2 has something better
*
* This class renders text inside a QGLWidget. It replaces the functionality
* of QGLWidget::renderText(). The advantages over renderText() include:
*  - supports any font, any character encoding supported by Qt
*    (renderText is 8-bit-only and can only use "OpenGL-compatible" fonts)
*  - does not use any library outside Qt (renderText uses FreeType on X11)
*  - renders characters as textured quads instead of calling glDrawPixels,
*    which does not make much of a difference on MesaGL, but can be a lot
*    faster and safer with other (buggy) OpenGL implementations. It will also
*    allow to add more graphical effects in the future, like rotation,
*    if we ever need that.
*  - the characters are stored as 8bpp Alpha, which takes 4 times less
*    memory than the 32bpp RGBA used by renderText.
*  - the characters are rendered on-the-fly on the first time they appear
*    in a QString being printed. This is achieved using a QHash to test whether
*    a character has already been rendered.
*
* Recommended usage:
* The TextRender class is meant to be used from inside a child class of
* QGLWidget, say MyGLWidget.
*
* In the declaration of MyGLWidget, please declare a TextRenderer member:
* 
* @code
class MyGLWidget : public QGLWidget
{
	...
	TextRenderer m_textRenderer;
	...
};
* @endcode
* 
* Now, in the constructor of MyGLWidget, please call setup() along these lines:
*
* @code
	QFont f;
	f.setStyleHint( QFont::SansSerif, QFont::PreferAntialias );
	m_textRenderer.setup( this, f );
* @endcode 
*
* The setup() method should be called only once, which means you have to choose
* a font once and for all, in the lifetime of your TextRenderer. Any QFont can
* be used, the above is just an example. Now, to actually render text, in
* the MyGLWidget::paintGL() method, you can call

* @code
	m_textRenderer.print( x, y, string );
* @endcode

* where x,y are ints and string is any QString. If you want to choose a color,
* please call glColor3f or glColor4f before calling print(). Of course you can
* also call qglColor or Color::apply. You can achieve semitransparent text at
* no additional cost by choosing a semitransparent color.
*
* If you wish to do several calls to print(), it will improve performance
* to enclose them between a call to begin() and a call to end(), like that:
* 
* @code
	m_textRenderer.begin();
	m_textRenderer.print( x1, y1, string1 );
	m_textRenderer.print( x2, y2, string2 );
	m_textRenderer.print( x3, y2, string3 );
	m_textRenderer.end();
* @endcode
* 
* Please make sure, though, that no relevant OpenGL state change occurs between
* begin() and end(), except the state changes performed by the TextRenderer
* itself. In other words, please avoid calling glSomething() between begin() and
* end(), except if you are sure that this call won't perform a relevant state
* change.
*
* The print() method when called alone, or the begin()-print()-end() group,
* do restore the OpenGL state as they found it, including the matrices.
*
* If you experience rendering problems, you can try the following:
* - disable some OpenGL state bits. For instance, TextRenderer automatically
*   disables fog and lighting during rendering, because it doesn't work
*   correctly with them enabled. There probably are other OpenGL state bits
*   that have to be disabled, so if your program enables some of them, you
*   might have to disable them before rendering text.
* - if you experience poor font quality, please consider using an antialiased
*   font.
