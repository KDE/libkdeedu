This libray consists of a group of classes which allow KDE 
applications to access calendar dates outside of the limited range 
of years imposed by QDate.

The QDate class has a limited range of valid dates.  It does not 
recognize dates prior to 14 Oct 1752 (when the Gregorian calendar 
was adopted by England), nor dates after 31 Dec 8000.  Both of these 
limits are arbitrary.


The following classes are included:

ExtDate:  Replaces QDate.  There is no restriction on what dates 
may be entered.  For dates in the valid QDate range, it is 
completely equivalent to QDate.

ExtDateTime:  Replaces QDateTime.  Consists of a QTime object
and an ExtDate object.

ExtCalendarSystem:  Replaces KCalendarSystem.  Uses ExtDate instead
of QDate.  ExtCalendarSystem is a baseclass foundation for several 
different calendar systems.  A "calendar system" is just a method for
hierarchically subdividing the long count of days known as the Julian 
Day Calendar into groups (weeks, months, years).  

ExtCalendarSystemGregorian:  Replaces KCalendarSystemGregorian.
The most common calendar system in modern western societies is the 
Gregorian calendar.  This class implements the Gregorian calendar 
as a ExtCalendarSystem.

ExtDateTable:  Replaces KDateTable.
ExtDatePicker:  Replaces KDatePicker.
ExtDateTimeEdit: Replaces QDateTimeEdit.
ExtDateWidget:  Replaces KDateWidget.

There are two test programs with the library, to verify the 
functionality of the ExtDate classes:

test_extdate tests the non-GUI functionality, comparing results of 
several operations with the results from QDate.

test_extdatepicker presents a KDatePicker widget and an ExtDatePicker
widget side-by-side.
